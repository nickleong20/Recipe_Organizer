# Week 1: RStudio Connection

## Repositories
Repositories are used to store and manage code, project files, documentation, and other resources related to software development or collaborative projects. They serve as a central location where all project files and version history are stored. They can be used for backup/recovery of files, collaboration efforts such as code sharing and reuse, editing, and documentation. GitHub is a site that is used to host these repositories for people to collaborate on. 

To create my repo, I followed the steps outlined in [How to Use Git/GitHub with R](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/)

## Important Functions for Repos
### Committing Data
Committing data will allow the code to be saved periodically and transferred between GitHub and RStudio

### Push
Pushing is the action of transferring edits from RStudio to GitHub. 

### Pull
When you pull code, it takes the code that is present on GitHub and transfers it to RStudio.
