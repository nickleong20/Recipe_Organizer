# Week 1: RStudio Connection

## GitHub Setup
- Install GitHub using the xcode-select --install functino
- Install the "usethis" package and run the edit_git_config() function: Input email and username to configure
- Input use_git() function into working directory and run code to initialize a repository and access the Git tab: Any changes made will appear in the Git tab
### Committing Data
Committing data will allow the code to be saved periodically and transferred between GitHub and RStudio. In order to do this, we can click on the Git tab and select the boxes for the changes that we want to save. 

Then click on the "commit" button and add a description for what is being changed. 

Finally, confirm the commit by selecting "commit" one more time and the code will be saved. You can view commit history by clicking on the clock icon or "history" button. 

## Connect GitHub to RStudio

## Pushing and Pulling
### Push
Pushing is the action of transferring edits from RStudio to GitHub. 

To do this, any changes made need to be committed. Then press the "Push" button to send the data to GitHub.

### Pull
When you pull code, it takes the code that is present on GitHub and transfers it to RStudio.

To pull, press the "Pull" button on the Git tab and it will take the code from your repository and transfer it into the RStudio directory.
