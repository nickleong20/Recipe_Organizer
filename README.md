## Connect GitHub to RStudio

## Pushing and Pulling
### Push
Pushing is the action of transferring edits from RStudio to GitHub. 

To do this, you need to commit any changes that you have made. Then you can press the "Push" button to send the data to GitHub.

### Pull
When you pull code, it takes the code that is present on GitHub and transfers it to RStudio.

To pull, you simply press the "Pull" button on the Git tab and it will take the code from your repository and transfer it into the RStudio directory.
