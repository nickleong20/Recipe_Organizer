# Recipe Organizer
I am creating a better way to look for and access your recipes in the kitchen. All you need to do is input them into this code and it will create an organized table that gives you the name, ingredients, and instructions for your recipe. It is super easy to use and stay organized. All contributions to improving functionality and usability are welcome.

# Functions
add_recipe("recipe name", "ingredients", "instructions"

search_by_ingredient("ingredient")
